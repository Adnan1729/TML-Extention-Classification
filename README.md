# TML-Extention-Classification
Extension of Transformational Machine Learning to Classification Problems: The aim of this project is to extend the approach to classification problemsin drug design. Specifically, the research task is to determine if the transformational machine learning approach improves predictive accuracy when the task is the binary classification of highly active compounds against others in the presence of severe class imbalance
